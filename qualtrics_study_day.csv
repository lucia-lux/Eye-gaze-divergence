Please do not reveal your guess to the experimenter.","From this evening and for the next 6 nights at 21:00 we will be sending you an email with a link to an online diary in which we will ask you to record any spontaneous memories you might have had about the film clips you saw today.
	
		Please fill these out in the hour before you go to bed.
		This evening, please only enter memories that occur to you after leaving UCL today.
	
	
	You will also be sent a final set of surveys in 7 days time at 08:00 am.
	This is a really important part of the study, so please make sure to fill out all of the diaries to the best of your ability.  
	
		This research aims to help understand Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) so that we can improve our prevention and treatment of this condition, and it is funded by a charity.
	
	


 

We would like you to read the following through and ask questions if anything is not clear.



The aim of our research is to look at spontaneous, involuntary memories because they seem to be important in many psychological disorders, especially PTSD.



By ‘spontaneous’, we mean memories of the film that suddenly pop into your mind automatically. We do not mean times when you deliberately think about it or mull it over. The spontaneous memories may pop into your mind when you are doing or thinking about something completely unrelated. Or you may be reminded of the film by things that happen in your environment. The main thing is that you didn't mean to think about the film, but recall something about it, 'out of the blue.'


Spontaneous memories may take the form of 'mental pictures' of the film you saw. They can be visual, but they can also be in any other sensory modality, so you might have memories of the sounds you heard. They can also take a verbal form – that is, words or sentences, statements or questions. Or they could be a mixture of sensory and verbal forms. The key thing is that they should be related to the film and they should occur out of the blue, without you trying to think about them.



Holding this in mind, we will ask you each evening if you have experienced any intrusive memories of the film that day and ask you to answer yes or no:","Intrusions diary - **EXAMPLE**   The purpose of this page is to record any unwanted involuntary m... - COLUMN 1
